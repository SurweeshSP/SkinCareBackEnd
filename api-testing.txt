1. Database Seeding
I have created a script to verify your database and S3 connectivity by creating a test user and a dummy analysis.

Run the Seed Script
(I will create this script as scripts/seed.js next. You will run it with node scripts/seed.js)

2. Postman / Curl Test Links (Localhost)
Use these URLs in Postman. Use http, not https, for localhost.

Auth
    Register: 
    POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register
    Body: 
        {"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123", "firstName": "Test", "lastName": "User"}

    Login: 
    POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login
    Body: 
        {"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}

    Save the token from the response!

Analyses (Requires Header Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>)
Create: 
    POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyses/create
    Body: 
        {"imageUrl": "test_image_key"}

    Get All: 
    GET http://localhost:3000/api/analyses/history

    Users (Requires Header Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>)
    Profile: 
    GET http://localhost:3000/api/users/profile

    3. Findings from Code Review
        Dependencies: All present (@aws-sdk/client-s3, @prisma/client, express).
            Prisma Schema: Defines User, Analysis, SkincareRoutine.
            Controllers: Mapped correctly.
            Potential Issue: 
                RoutineController
                expects req.body.steps. If frontend sends an Array, it might crash because Prisma expects a String. Fix: Ensure frontend sends JSON string or backend stringifies it.
